My Lovely Project
=================

A great example repo you can fork to your heart’s content, that serves as a launchpad for working your way through the amazing **[Learning GitHub](http://shop.oreilly.com/category/videos/programming.do)** video training series.

## Getting started

The first thing you want to do with this repo is quite likely [**fork it**](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).  Use the Fork button in the top-right section of the page to do this.

Once you’re on your fork, you can experiment however you like with it, play with branches, issues, milestones, labels, the wiki, and more.

## What’s in there?

Various files to support upcoming GitHub tasks the series trains you for, but more importantly, demonstration out-of-codebase contents (e.g. issues and milestones) so you can get a feeling of what features GitHub offers without having to first create such content or data.  The video series frequently uses this repository as a way of touring trainees briefly through these features before tackling them.
